InfiniBand Transport (IBTRS)
****************************

IBTRS (InfiniBand Transport) is a reliable high speed transport library
which provides support to establish optimal number of connections
between client and server machines using RDMA (InfiniBand, RoCE, iWarp)
transport. It is optimized to transfer (read/write) IO blocks.

In its core interface it follows the BIO semantics of providing the
possibility to either write data from an sg list to the remote side
or to request ("read") data transfer from the remote side into a given
sg list.

IBTRS provides I/O fail-over and load-balancing capabilities by using
multipath I/O (see "add_path" and "mp_policy" configuration entries).

IBTRS is used by the IBNBD (Infiniband Network Block Device) modules.

======================
Client Sysfs Interface
======================

This chapter describes only the most important files of sysfs interface
on client side.

Entries under /sys/devices/virtual/ibtrs-client/
================================================

When a user of IBTRS API creates a new session, a directory entry with
the name of that session is created.

Entries under /sys/devices/virtual/ibtrs-client/<session-name>/
===============================================================

add_path (RW)
-------------

Adds a new path (connection) to an existing session. Expected format is the
following:

  <[source addr,]destination addr>

  *addr ::= [ ip:<ipv4|ipv6> | gid:<gid> ]

max_reconnect_attempts (RW)
---------------------------

Maximum number reconnect attempts the client should make before giving up
after connection breaks unexpectedly.

mp_policy (RW)
--------------

Multipath policy specifies which path should be selected on each IO:

   round-robin (0):
       select path in per CPU round-robin manner.

   min-inflight (1):
       select path with minimum inflights.

Entries under /sys/devices/virtual/ibtrs-client/<session-name>/paths/
=====================================================================


Each path belonging to a given session is listed here by its destination
address. When a new path is added to a session by writing to the "add_path"
entry, a directory with the corresponding destination address is created.

Entries under /sys/devices/virtual/ibtrs-client/<session-name>/paths/<dest-addr>/
=================================================================================

state (R)
---------

Contains "connected" if the session is connected to the peer and fully
functional.  Otherwise the file contains "disconnected"

reconnect (RW)
--------------

Write "1" to the file in order to reconnect the path.
Operation is blocking and returns 0 if reconnect was successful.

disconnect (RW)
---------------

Write "1" to the file in order to disconnect the path.
Operation blocks until IBTRS path is disconnected.

remove_path (RW)
----------------

Write "1" to the file in order to disconnected and remove the path
from the session.  Operation blocks until the path is disconnected
and removed from the session.

Entries under /sys/devices/virtual/ibtrs-client/<session-name>/paths/<dest-addr>/stats/
=======================================================================================

Write "0" to any file in that directory to reset corresponding statistics.

reset_all (RW)
--------------

Read will return usage help, write 0 will clear all the statistics.

sg_entries (RW)
---------------

Data to be transferred via RDMA is passed to IBTRS as scatter-gather
list. A scatter-gather list can contain multiple entries.
Scatter-gather list with less entries require less processing power
and can therefore transferred faster. The file sg_entries outputs a
per-CPU distribution table for the number of entries in the
scatter-gather lists, that were passed to the IBTRS API function
ibtrs_clt_request (READ or WRITE).

cpu_migration (RW)
------------------

IBTRS expects that each HCA IRQ is pinned to a separate CPU. If it's
not the case, the processing of an I/O response could be processed on a
different CPU than where it was originally submitted.  This file shows
how many interrupts where generated on a non expected CPU.
"from:" is the CPU on which the IRQ was expected, but not generated.
"to:" is the CPU on which the IRQ was generated, but not expected.

reconnects (RW)
---------------

Contains 2 unsigned int values, the first one records number of successful
reconnects in the path lifetime, the second one records number of failed
reconnects in the path lifetime.

rdma_lat (RW)
-------------

Latency distribution of IBTRS requests.
The format is:
   1 ms: <CNT-LAT-READ> <CNT-LAT-WRITE>
   2 ms: <CNT-LAT-READ> <CNT-LAT-WRITE>
   4 ms: <CNT-LAT-READ> <CNT-LAT-WRITE>
   8 ms: <CNT-LAT-READ> <CNT-LAT-WRITE>
  16 ms: <CNT-LAT-READ> <CNT-LAT-WRITE>
  ...
  65536 ms: <CNT-LAT-READ> <CNT-LAT-WRITE>
  >= 65536 ms: <CNT-LAT-READ> <CNT-LAT-WRITE>
  maximum ms: <CNT-LAT-READ> <CNT-LAT-WRITE>

wc_completion (RW)
------------------

Contains 2 unsigned int values, the first one records max number of work
requests processed in work_completion in session lifetime, the second
one records average number of work requests processed in work_completion
in session lifetime.

rdma (RW)
---------

Contains statistics regarding rdma operations and inflight operations.
The output consists of 6 values:

<read-count> <read-total-size> <write-count> <write-total-size> \
<inflights> <failovered>

======================
Server Sysfs Interface
======================

Entries under /sys/devices/virtual/ibtrs-server/
================================================

When a user of IBTRS API creates a new session on a client side, a
directory entry with the name of that session is created in here.

Entries under /sys/devices/virtual/ibtrs-server/<session-name>/paths/
=====================================================================

When new path is created by writing to "add_path" entry on client side,
a directory entry with source address is created on server.

Entries under /sys/devices/virtual/ibtrs-server/<session-name>/paths/<source-addr>/
===================================================================================

disconnect (RW)
---------------

When "1" is written to the file, the IBTRS session is being disconnected.
Operations is non-blocking and returns control immediately to the caller.

hca_name (R)
------------

Contains the the name of HCA the connection established on.

hca_port (R)
------------

Contains the port number of active port traffic is going through.

Entries under /sys/devices/virtual/ibtrs-server/<session-name>/paths/<source-addr>/stats/
=========================================================================================

When "0" is written to a file in this directory, the corresponding counters
will be reset.

reset_all (RW)
--------------

Read will return usage help, write 0 will clear all the counters about
stats.

rdma (RW)
---------

Contains statistics regarding rdma operations and inflight operations.
The output consists of 5 values:

<read-count> <read-total-size> <write-count> <write-total-size> <inflights>

wc_completion (RW)
------------------

Contains 3 values, the first one is int, records max number of work
requests processed in work_completion in session lifetime, the second
one long int records total number of work requests processed in
work_completion in session lifetime and the 3rd one long int records
total number of calls to the cq completion handler. Division of 2nd
number through 3rd gives the average number of completions processed
in completion handler.

==================
Transport protocol
==================

Overview
--------
An established connection between a client and a server is called ibtrs
session. A session is associated with a set of memory chunks reserved on the
server side for a given client for rdma transfer. A session
consists of multiple paths, each representing a separate physical link
between client and server. Those are used for load balancing and failover.
Each path consists of as many connections (QPs) as there are cpus on
the client.

When processing an incoming rdma write or read request ibtrs client uses memory
chunks reserved for him on the server side. Their number, size and addresses
need to be exchanged between client and server during the connection
establishment phase. Apart from the memory related information client needs to
inform the server about the session name and identify each path and connection
individually.

On an established session client sends to server write or read messages.
Server uses immediate field to tell the client which request is being
acknowledged and for errno. Client uses immediate field to tell the server
which of the memory chunks has been accessed and at which offset the message
can be found.

Connection establishment
------------------------

1. Client starts establishing connections belonging to a path of a session one
by one via attaching IBTRS_MSG_CON_REQ messages to the rdma_connect requests.
Those include uuid of the session and uuid of the path to be
established. They are used by the server to find a persisting session/path or
to create a new one when necessary. The message also contains the protocol
version and magic for compatibility, total number of connections per session
(as many as cpus on the client), the id of the current connection and
the reconnect counter, which is used to resolve the situations where
client is trying to reconnect a path, while server is still destroying the old
one.

2. Server accepts the connection requests one by one and attaches
IBTRS_MSG_CONN_RSP messages to the rdma_accept. Apart from magic and
protocol version, the messages include error code, queue depth supported by
the server (number of memory chunks which are going to be allocated for that
session) and the maximum size of one io.

3. After all connections of a path are established client sends to server the
IBTRS_MSG_INFO_REQ message, containing the name of the session. This message
requests the address information from the server.

4. Server replies to the session info request message with IBTRS_MSG_INFO_RSP,
which contains the addresses and keys of the RDMA buffers allocated for that
session.

5. Session becomes connected after all paths to be established are connected
(i.e. steps 1-4 finished for all paths requested for a session)

6. Server and client exchange periodically heartbeat messages (empty rdma
messages with an immediate field) which are used to detect a crash on remote
side or network outage in an absence of IO.

7. On any RDMA related error or in the case of a heartbeat timeout, the
corresponding path is disconnected, all the inflight IO are failed over to a
healthy path, if any, and the reconnect mechanism is triggered.

*for each connection belonging to a path and for each path:
IBTRS_MSG_CON_REQ  ------------------->
                   <------------------- IBTRS_MSG_CON_RSP
...

IBTRS_MSG_INFO_REQ ------------------->
                   <------------------- IBTRS_MSG_INFO_RSP
*heartbeat is started from both sides:

[IBTRS_HB_MSG_IMM] <-------------------
                   -------------------> [IBTRS_HB_MSG_ACK]

IO path
-------

* Write *

1. When processing a write request client selects one of the memory chunks
on the server side and rdma writes there the user data, user header and the
IBTRS_MSG_RDMA_WRITE message. Apart from the type (write), the message only
contains size of the user header. The client tells the server which chunk has
been accessed and at what offset the IBTRS_MSG_RDMA_WRITE can be found by
using the IMM field.

2. When confirming a write request server sends an "empty" rdma message with
an immediate field. The 32 bit field is used to specify the outstanding
inflight IO and for the error code.

CLT                                                          SRV
usr_data + usr_hdr + ibtrs_msg_rdma_write -----------------> [IBTRS_IO_REQ_IMM]
[IBTRS_IO_RSP_IMM]                        <----------------- (id + errno)

* Read *

1. When processing a read request client selects one of the memory chunks
on the server side and rdma writes there the user header and the
IBTRS_MSG_RDMA_READ message. This message contains the type (read), size of
the user header, flags (specifying if memory invalidation is necessary) and the
list of addresses along with keys for the data to be read into.

2. When confirming a read request server transfers the requested data first,
attaches an invalidation message if requested and finally an "empty" rdma
message with an immediate field. The 32 bit field is used to specify the
outstanding inflight IO and the error code.

CLT                                           SRV
usr_hdr + ibtrs_msg_rdma_read --------------> [IBTRS_IO_REQ_IMM]
[IBTRS_IO_RSP_IMM]            <-------------- usr_data + (id + errno)
or in case client requested invalidation:
[IBTRS_IO_RSP_IMM_W_INV]      <-------------- usr_data + (INV) + (id + errno)
