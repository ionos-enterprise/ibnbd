Infiniband Network Block Device (IBNBD)
***************************************

Introduction
------------

IBNBD (InfiniBand Network Block Device) is a pair of kernel modules
(client and server) that allow for remote access of a block device on
the server over IBTRS protocol using the RDMA (InfiniBand, RoCE, iWarp)
transport. After being mapped, the remote block devices can be accessed
on the client side as local block devices.

I/O is transfered between client and server by the IBTRS transport
modules. The administration of IBNBD and IBTRS modules is done via
sysfs entries.

Requirements
------------

  IBTRS kernel modules

Quick Start
-----------

Server side:
  # modprobe ibnbd_server

Client side:
  # modprobe ibnbd_client
  # echo "sessname=blya path=ip:10.50.100.66 device_path=/dev/ram0" > \
            /sys/devices/virtual/ibnbd-client/ctl/map_device

  Where "sessname=" is a session name, a string to identify the session
  on client and on server sides; "path=" is a destination IP address or
  a pair of a source and a destination IPs, separated by comma.  Multiple
  "path=" options can be specified in order to use multipath  (see IBTRS
  description for details); "device_path=" is the block device to be
  mapped from the server side. After the session to the server machine is
  established, the mapped device will appear on the client side under
  /dev/ibnbd<N>.


======================
Client Sysfs Interface
======================

All sysfs files that are not read-only provide the usage information on read:

Example:
  # cat /sys/devices/virtual/ibnbd-client/ctl/map_device

  > Usage: echo "sessname=<name of the ibtrs session> path=<[srcaddr,]dstaddr>
  > [path=<[srcaddr,]dstaddr>] device_path=<full path on remote side>
  > [access_mode=<ro|rw|migration>]
  > [io_mode=<fileio|blockio>]" > map_device
  >
  > addr ::= [ ip:<ipv4> | ip:<ipv6> | gid:<gid> ]

Entries under /sys/devices/virtual/ibnbd-client/ctl/
=======================================

map_device (RW)
---------------

Expected format is the following:

    sessname=<name of the ibtrs session>
    path=<[srcaddr,]dstaddr> [path=<[srcaddr,]dstaddr> ...]
    device_path=<full path on remote side>
    [access_mode=<ro|rw|migration>]
    [io_mode=<fileio|blockio>]

Where:

sessname: accepts a string not bigger than 256 chars, which identifies
          a given session on the client and on the server.
          I.e. "clt_hostname-srv_hostname" could be a natural choice.

path:     describes a connection between the client and the server by
      specifying destination and, when required, the source address.
      The addresses are to be provided in the following format:

            ip:<IPv6>
            ip:<IPv4>
            gid:<GID>

          for example:

          path=ip:10.0.0.66
                         The single addr is treated as the destination.
                         The connection will be established to this
                         server from any client IP address.

          path=ip:10.0.0.66,ip:10.0.1.66
                         First addr is the source address and the second
                         is the destination.

          If multiple "path=" options are specified multiple connection
          will be established and data will be sent according to
          the selected multipath policy (see IBTRS mp_policy sysfs entry
          description).

device_path: Path to the block device on the server side. Path is specified
         relative to the directory on server side configured in the
         'dev_search_path' module parameter of the ibnbd_server.
         The ibnbd_server prepends the <device_path> received from client
         with <dev_search_path> and tries to open the
         <dev_search_path>/<device_path> block device.  On success,
         a /dev/ibnbd<N> device file, a /sys/block/ibnbd_client/ibnbd<N>/
         directory and an entry in /sys/devices/virtual/ibnbd-client/ctl/devices
         will be created.

         If 'dev_search_path' contains '%SESSNAME%', then each session can
         have different devices namespace, e.g. server was configured with
         the following parameter "dev_search_path=/run/ibnbd-devs/%SESSNAME%",
         client has this string "sessname=blya device_path=sda", then server
         will try to open: /run/ibnbd-devs/blya/sda.

access_mode: the access_mode parameter specifies if the device is to be
             mapped as "ro" read-only or "rw" read-write. The server allows
             a device to be exported in rw mode only once. The "migration"
             access mode has to be specified if a second mapping in read-write
             mode is desired.

             By default "rw" is used.

io_mode:  the io_mode parameter specifies if the device on the server
          will be opened as block device "blockio" or as file "fileio".
          When the device is opened as file, the VFS page cache is used
          for read I/O operations, write I/O operations bypass the page
          cache and go directly to disk (except meta updates, like file
          access time).

          By default "blockio" mode is used.

Exit Codes:

If the device is already mapped it will fail with EEXIST. If the input
has an invalid format it will return EINVAL. If the device path cannot
be found on the server, it will fail with ENOENT.

Finding device file after mapping
---------------------------------

After mapping, the device file can be found by:
 o  The symlink /sys/devices/virtual/ibnbd-client/ctl/devices/<device_id>
    points to /sys/block/<dev-name>. The last part of the symlink destination
    is the same as the device name.  By extracting the last part of the
    path the path to the device /dev/<dev-name> can be build.

 o /dev/block/$(cat /sys/devices/virtual/ibnbd-client/ctl/devices/<device_id>/dev)

How to find the <device_id> of the device is described on the next
section.

Entries under /sys/devices/virtual/ibnbd-client/ctl/devices/
============================================================

For each device mapped on the client a new symbolic link is created as
/sys/devices/virtual/ibnbd-client/ctl/devices/<device_id>, which points
to the block device created by ibnbd (/sys/block/ibnbd<N>/).
The <device_id> of each device is created as follows:

- If the 'device_path' provided during mapping contains slashes ("/"),
  they are replaced by exclamation mark ("!") and used as as the
  <device_id>. Otherwise, the <device_id> will be the same as the
  "device_path" provided.

Entries under /sys/block/ibnbd<N>/ibnbd_client/
===============================================

unmap_device (RW)
-----------------

To unmap a volume, "normal" or "force" has to be written to:
  /sys/block/ibnbd<N>/ibnbd_client/unmap_device

When "normal" is used, the operation will fail with EBUSY if any process
is using the device.  When "force" is used, the device is also unmapped
when device is in use.  All I/Os that are in progress will fail.

Example:

   # echo "normal" > /sys/block/ibnbd0/ibnbd/unmap_device

state (RO)
----------

The file contains the current state of the block device. The state file
returns "open" when the device is successfully mapped from the server
and accepting I/O requests. When the connection to the server gets
disconnected in case of an error (e.g. link failure), the state file
returns "closed" and all I/O requests submitted to it will fail with -EIO.

session (RO)
------------

IBNBD uses IBTRS session to transport the data between client and
server.  The entry "session" contains the name of the session, that
was used to establish the IBTRS session.  It's the same name that
was passed as server parameter to the map_device entry.

mapping_path (RO)
-----------------

Contains the path that was passed as "device_path" to the map_device
operation.

======================
Server Sysfs Interface
======================

Entries under /sys/devices/virtual/ibnbd-server/ctl/
====================================================

When a client maps a device, a directory entry with the name of the
block device is created under /sys/devices/virtual/ibnbd-server/ctl/devices/.

Entries under /sys/devices/virtual/ibnbd-server/ctl/devices/<device_name>/
==========================================================================

block_dev (link)
---------------

Is a symlink to the sysfs entry of the exported device.

Example:

  block_dev -> ../../../../devices/virtual/block/ram0

Entries under /sys/devices/virtual/ibnbd-server/ctl/devices/<device_name>/sessions/
===================================================================================

For each client a particular device is exported to, following directory will be
created:

/sys/devices/virtual/ibnbd-server/ctl/devices/<device_name>/sessions/<session-name>/

When the device is unmapped by that client, the directory will be removed.

Entries under /sys/devices/virtual/ibnbd-server/ctl/devices/<device_name>/sessions/<session-name>
=================================================================================================

read_only (RO)
--------------

Contains '1' if device is mapped read-only, otherwise '0'.

mapping_path (RO)
-----------------

Contains the relative device path provided by the user during mapping.

==============================
IBNBD-Server Module Parameters
==============================

dev_search_path
---------------

When a device is mapped from the client, the server generates the path
to the block device on the server side by concatenating dev_search_path
and the "device_path" that was specified in the map_device operation.

The default dev_search_path is: "/".

dev_search_path option can also contain %SESSNAME% in order to provide
different deviec namespaces for different sessions.  See "device_path"
option for details.

==============================
Protocol (ibnbd/ibnbd-proto.h)
==============================

1. Before mapping first device from a given server, client sends an
IBNBD_MSG_SESS_INFO to the server. Server responds with
IBNBD_MSG_SESS_INFO_RSP. Currently the messages only contain the protocol
version for backward compatibility.

2. Client requests to open a device by sending IBNBD_MSG_OPEN message. This
contains the path to the device, access mode (read-only or writable), and
io_mode which specifies if the device should be opened as block device or
using file io. Server responds to the message with IBNBD_MSG_OPEN_RSP. This
contains a 32 bit device id to be used for  IOs and device "geometry" related
information: side, max_hw_sectors, etc.

3. Client attaches IBNBD_MSG_IO to each IO message send to a device. This
message contains device id, provided by server in his ibnbd_msg_open_rsp,
sector to be accessed, read-write flags and bi_size.

4. Client closes a device by sending IBNBD_MSG_CLOSE which contains only the
device id provided by the server.
